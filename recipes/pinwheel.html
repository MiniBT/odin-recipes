        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is my go-to finger food for any party - it's super quick and easy to make and all you need is puff pastry, cheese, and herbed cream cheese. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
            <li>1 container cream cheese with herbs</li>
            <li>6 ounces sliced Swiss cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Dust a flat work surface lightly with flour. Unroll puff pastry and roll out to a rectangle. Spread a thin layer of herbed cream cheese over the puff pastry. Cover with Swiss cheese slices, leaving a 1-inch border. Roll puff pastry up tightly like a jelly roll.</li>
            <li>Slice puff pastry roll in 1/4-inch-thick slices and lay on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven on the center rack until lightly browned and puffed up, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
